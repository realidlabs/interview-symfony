# Interview Symfony

For this interview you will be recreating an html website and put it into a Symfony application using twig.

https://www.rtenant.com/eviction-reports/ - This is the page you will be recreating

What I will be looking at is more or less the templates you generate. I will be looking at how you use twig and how you structure your templates.

I have added all the required assets to Symfony in /public/(css|js|images)

The html file can be found at: [Eviction Reports assets](https://github.com/realidlabs/interview/tree/master/frontend-1/eviction-reports)


In src/Controller/EvicitionReportController.php you will find the route for the page with an example hero $params to get you started.

The main entrypoint for this template can be found in templates/eviction-reports/index.html.twig

This template is pretty barebones and includes an example hero section. You will need to create the rest of the page using twig.
